# How goes it, I’m Yara 👋  

I’m a **full-stack engineer**. Fuled by curiousity.

I enjoy working across the stack — from clean, responsive UIs to reliable backend systems — and I care a lot about writing code that *makes sense to the next person reading it* (usually future me).

## About me:

- Based in **Egypt**.  
- Strong English speaker.  
- Comfortable collaborating async across time zones.  
- Always learning.


## Here you'll find:

- Trill Desktop! My Chord Finder project.
- Personal and hobby projects  
- Experiments while learning new concepts  
- Code that reflects how I think, not just what I know

Some repos are polished, some are messy — both are intentional 🙂

If you’re building something interesting and need someone who cares about both **engineering** and **details**, I’d love to chat.
