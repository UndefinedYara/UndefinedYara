# Hi, I’m Yara 👋  

I’m a **full-stack engineer**. Fuled by curiousity.

I enjoy working across the stack — from clean, responsive UIs to reliable backend systems — and I care a lot about writing code that *makes sense to the next person reading it* (usually future me).

---

## 🧠 What I work with

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** NestJS, Node.js, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** SQL / relational databases  
- **Other:** Git, Docker, basic system design, debugging real-world issues

---

## 🛠 What I like building

- Dashboards & data-heavy UIs  
- Internal tools & admin panels  
- Backend APIs that support real users  
- Projects that feel *useful*, not just impressive


---

## 🌍 About me

- Based in **Egypt**.  
- Strong English speaker.  
- Comfortable collaborating async across time zones.  
- Always learning.

## 📌 What you’ll find here

- Trill Desktop! My Chord Finder project.
- Personal and hobby projects  
- Experiments while learning new concepts  
- Code that reflects how I think, not just what I know

Some repos are polished, some are messy — both are intentional 🙂
